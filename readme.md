# mac-recorder-app

A cli app that records audio from mic or your macbook, and stored it in a .wav file. 

## Requirements
- Rust setup in your local
- Cargo package manager.

## Steps to run
- Clone the repo
  > git clone https://github.com/anubhavitis/mac-recording-app
- ```cargo run```

## Note
I am particularly proud of this because I was able to interact with macos api, and input devices apart from a keyboard and mouse, and encode an audio stream of 32 bits float integers into a playable wav files. (I didn't cook everything, external libraries were saviour)

However, I would love to try more stuff with this. Ping me if you have any suggestions or if you wanna work together on this.
